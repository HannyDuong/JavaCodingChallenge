### What is the main difference between Java and Python?
    * Java is an object-oriented language. 
    * Java is a concurrent, class-based, independent language.
    * Java is the best-suited language to develop:
        * Enterprise Solutions
        * Desktop or web application
        * Embedded systems
        * Middleware applications
    
    * Java is complied and statically-typed language means,
        * Java is mandatory to declare variables explicitly.
        * Java is difficult to learn and has more line of code.
        * However, Java's performance is faster than Python.

    
    * Python is scripting language which is used to develop
        * Machine learning applications
        * Operating System
        * Language development
        * Games
        * Prototyping
        * Image Processing

    * Python is an interpreted, dynamically-typed programming language. 
        * It means, there is no need to declare variables.
        * Python is easy to learn and has less line of code
        * However, Python performance is slower than java.
