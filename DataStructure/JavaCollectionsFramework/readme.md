### Java Collections Framework
    * The Java collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces
    that implement commonly reusable collection data structures
    for storing and manipulating a group of objects..
    * Java collections framework works in a manner of a library.
    * The collections framework provides both interfaces that define various collections
    and classes that implement them.

#### What is Collection in Java?
    * A Collection represents a single unit of objects, such as a group.

#### What is a framework in Java?
    * Framework provides readymade architecture
    * Framework represents a set of classes and interfaces

#### How many types of Collection are there?
    * There are three generic types of collection: ordered lists, dictionaries/maps, and sets
        * Ordered lists allows the programmer to insert items
        in a certain order and retrieve those items in the same order. 
        Using List and Queue interfaces.

        * Dictionaries/maps store references to objects with a lookup key to access
        the object's values. Using Map interface

        * Sets are unordered collections that can be iterated and contain 
        each element at most once.
        Using Set interface.
