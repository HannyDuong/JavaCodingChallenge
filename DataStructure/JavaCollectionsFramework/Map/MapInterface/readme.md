### Java Map Interface
    * A map contains key and value pair.
    * Each key and value pair is known as an entry.
    * A Map contains *unique keys*.
    * A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
    * A map doesn't allow duplicated keys, but you can have duplicated values.
    * A Map can't be traversed, so you need to convert it into Set using keySet() or entrySet() method
    
    * There are two interfaces for implementing Map: Map and SortedMap.
    * Three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap

    * HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't.

#### HashMap
    * HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
