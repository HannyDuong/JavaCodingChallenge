#### HashMap
    * HashMap is the implementation of Map, *but it doesn't maintain any order.*
    * HashMap stores key and value pair, where keys should be unique.
    * If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key.
    * HashMap is non synchronized
    * HashMap allows to store only one null key but mutiple null values
    * HashMap<K,V>
