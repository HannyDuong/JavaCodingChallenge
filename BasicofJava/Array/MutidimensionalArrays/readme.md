#### What is multidimensional array?
    * Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays.
    * Data in multidimentional arrays are stored in tabular form.
    
#### How to find the size of multidimensional arrays?
    *  Multiplying the size of all the dimensions
    * Example: int[][] = new int[5][4] => 5*4 = 20 elements

#### What is 2D-array or two-dimensional array?
    * A two-dimensional array is an array of one-dimensional array. Or
    * A 2D array is an table with x-rows and y-columns
    * x and y range from 0 -> x-1 or 0 -> y-1

#### How to output all the elements of a two-dimensional array?
    * Use nested for loops. 
    * One for loop to traverse the rows and another to traverse the columns.

#### Why do we use multidimensional array?
    * To store data for mathematic computations, image processing, and record management.
