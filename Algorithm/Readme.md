#### What is algorithm in computing?
	Algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output  

#### What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?
	There are number of problems such as:
	* For data analysis
	* For managing and manipulating large volume of data
	* Search engine
	* Sorting
	* And so on
	
#### Which algorithm is used to sort?
	* Insertion sort
	* Merge sort
	
#### For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?
	* Insertion sort runs faster than merge sort for small input size
	* Merge sort is faster than  insertion sort for large input size
	* When  2<n<= 43 , insertion sort beat merge sort
